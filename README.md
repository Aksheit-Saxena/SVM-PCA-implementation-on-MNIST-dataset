# SVM-PCA-implementation-on-MNIST-dataset

Task 1: Using PCA , reduced the dimensionality of the images from 784 to
 a lower number of principal components (k = {5,10,20,50,100,200,500})

Task 2 : Fitting the MNSIT digits to SVM classifier

Task 3:Perform a comparative study by trying out various combinations of the following:

   • Kernels: use linear, polynomial, and radial basis function kernel.
   • C: test out C = {0.1,1,10,100}
   • Gamma: (not applicable for linear kernel) test out γ = {1,0.1,0.01,0.001}
   For each of the kernels, find out the best combination of hyper-parameters: C and γ (grid search).
